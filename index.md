## Pretty Sheet Reporter

[Pretty Sheet Reporter](TODO:link) makes it simple to turn large amounts of dense text data in Google Sheets into cleanly-formatted Google Docs that enable simpler review and discussion.

Pretty Sheet Reporter is most helpful for Sheets that have a large number of rows with long blocks of text - it can be hard to see everything you need to at once in Sheets, but a Doc can make it much easier to navigate all your data. 

Turn this:
![Data sheet](https://github.com/jonathanbetz/pretty-sheet-reporting/blob/master/Muppets%20Data.png "Data sheet")

Into this:
![Pretty Report](https://github.com/jonathanbetz/pretty-sheet-reporting/blob/master/Muppets%20Report.png "Data report")


### Installation
#### Install the Pretty Sheet Reporter Add-on
Install the addon by clicking on the Add-ons menu in Google Sheets and searching for the Pretty Sheet Reporting add-on in the list of available add-ons.

The Pretty Sheet Reporter will then be installed and a dedicated menu will appear in the Add-ons menu.

You can then launch the add-on from the Add-ons menu in Google Sheets by clicking on Report in the Pretty Sheet Reporting submenu.

### Your First Report
* Each row in your sheet will get its own page
* The header for each page will be the data in the first column of the row
* All the frozen columns will appear directly below the header, without labels
* All other columns will appear in a simple layout that labels each of the values with the corresponding label from the sheet. 
* Any hidden rows or columns will be omitted from the report.
